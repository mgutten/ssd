                Stephen Shubel Inc. is a boutique design firm specializing in residential and 
                commercial projects for over thirty years.  Shubel and his principal designer Jennifer Atristain 
                work together today to achieve the success of the firm's many domestic and international properties.<br/><br/>


    			Stephen Shubel artfully guides the aesthetic direction of each project.  With Atristan and his colleagues 
                of trained and skillful designers they organize all projects directly with the client.  By nature design 
                is a collaborative process.  In this "team effort" Shubel sees each endeavor as a joint venture of the firm with 
                the client, architect, contractor and landscape designer. <br/><br/>

   				The approach to every unique job is simple. We seek a global perspective, focusing on creative, often luxurious, 
                interior design, and always with a healthy respect to architectural context.<br/><br/>

    			Our style has been acclaimed both in its classical and its modern approach.<br/><br/>

   				Understanding that truly good design is only as good as the craftspeople, the materials resourced and the client's 
                lifestyle, we strive to maintain all these design elements successfully.  Only when these elements work together can any 
                desired outcome occur.  Our solid associations with our vendors and respected sources insure high quality, flawless 
                products, and unwavering service. <br/><br/>

   				Whether the job is a small country cottage or a high-tech villa our efforts are tireless.  Within our overall 
                view we always stay focused on all design details, a project's time frame and the personal budget of each client.<br/><br/>

  				Throughout the years and especially today Shubel believes our primary focus is to create timeless, beautiful, 
                functional design.  Our main mission is to enrich the lives of our clients.  And in a changing world we pursue a
                 long-lasting relationship to continue confirming their philosophy and personal taste.<br/><br/>
